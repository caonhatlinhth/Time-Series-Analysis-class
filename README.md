**Time Series Analysis Class**

This repository contains the code for the assignments completed during the Time Series Analysis class. The assignments focus on the application of time series models and techniques using R programming for analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data.

**Project Background**

The Time Series Analysis class assignments aim to develop skills and knowledge in analyzing and modeling time series data. By utilizing R programming, time series models, and statistical techniques, the assignments explore various aspects of time series analysis, including data preprocessing, model selection, forecasting, and evaluation.

**Contents**
- Code: R scripts and notebooks containing the code for the assignments, including data preprocessing, time series model implementation, forecasting, and evaluation techniques.
- Datasets: Time series datasets used in the assignments, including any preprocessed or derived datasets.
- Reports: Reports outlining the assignment objectives, methodology, analysis, and findings.
- Figures: Visualizations, charts, and figures generated during the analysis.
- References: Relevant research papers, articles, and resources used for the assignments.

**Assignment Topics**

The assignments cover a wide range of time series analysis topics, including:
- Time series data visualization and exploration.
- Time series decomposition and trend analysis.
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling.
- Exponential smoothing methods.
- Seasonal decomposition of time series.
- Forecasting techniques and model evaluation.
- Advanced topics in time series analysis (e.g., state space models, spectral analysis, etc.).

**Usage**

Feel free to explore the code and datasets provided in this repository. The code contains R scripts and notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of time series models, forecasting techniques, and evaluation methods. The reports provide an overview of the assignment objectives, methodology, analysis, and findings.
